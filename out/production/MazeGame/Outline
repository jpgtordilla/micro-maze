Outline:
* Maze class
    * Generate a 2D maze array parameters of walls, spaces, player, and exit
    * Key presses update player position in O(1)
    * Count number of steps
    * If steps is equal to a number between 10-20, start a mini game compilation instance (static method from MiniGame class)
    * If the player is at the exit position, regenerate the maze, reset the player, and reset the steps
* MiniGame class
    * Static level counter
    * Picks a random method to run from an array of levels
    * For now, each method just has a print statement, and will later run a main class for each mini game
* Main class
    * Initialize how many levels and set level counter
    * Loop which contains the level handler
    * Calls an updateCurrentLevel() method in the Maze class which handles player position on Keyup
